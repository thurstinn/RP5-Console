Files named with Right/Left designate which parts are Right/Left with the console laying facedown, 
as would be during assembly. This was done because while designing I visualized the system this way,
and so I named the parts accordingly to avoid a mix-up. So right is actually left when the console is
facing you like normal and vice-versa.
